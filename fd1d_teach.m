function fd1d (M,a,b,ua,ub)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%       FD1D
%%       for MTH 453/553
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% This function shows how to set up the finite difference approximation of a 
%% model two-point boundary value problem -u''=f, on the interval [a,b], with 
%% Dirichlet boundary conditions ua (left) and ub (right), and default 
%% discretization 0....M.  
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Notes:
%% 1) Since MATLAB vectors aren't 0-indexed, we use 1..M+1 to label the nodes.
%% 2) The user must code the expression for f below (rhsfun).
%% 3) The user must code the expression for the exact solution below (exfun).


    %% >>> Question to MP: What do you mean by this?  It seems these are inputs ua and ub?
%% and set up /change boundary conditions 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% Outputs:
%% This function will output a plot of both the exact solution and the 
%% numerical solution, along with reporting the max-norm error between the two.
